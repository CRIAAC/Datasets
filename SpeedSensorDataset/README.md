Details
---

As explained in our paper, we did our experiment on a 5-meter path. 
We also wanted to know which person is passing in front of our module : to do so, we put 3 wristbands in the appartment and one on the participant. 

Our program is continously checking for the wristbands, especially whenever the module is activated. It will be referred in the files as _NearestWristband_.


Speed Evaluation

The folder ```RawSpeedEvaluation/``` contains every participant's data for the speed detection.
